-Today I uploaded an example file of a p5.js sketch.

Jan 14
-Today I edited the p5.js sketch file. I made the background orange, the circle randomly change colours, and the position of the circle to follow the user's cursor rather than
moving randomly. A couple small changes I also made were the canvas size and the circle's size.

Jan 15
-Nothing.

Jan 16
-Nothing.

Jan 17
-Today I edited the p5.js sketch file even furthur. I made it so that now the background stays black but only refreshes when the mouse is clicked, this allows the user to use
the screen like a canvas and drag the mouse around to 'paint' circles all over until they click (essentially to restart their drawing). Also, I decided to make the circle shape
slightly smaller so that it takes more circles to fill up the canvas. And finally, to add more interactivity, the user can select the colour of the circle themself using the 
keys on their keyboard. So... click 'r' for red, click 'g' for green, click 'b' for blue, and click 'a' for random. 

Jan 18
-Today I uploaded the extension demo files to my repo.

Jan 19
-Today I uploaded the second extension demo file to my repo.

Jan 20
-Today I joined the EECS 1720 github organization 

Jan 21
-Today I edited the more-extension-demo extension on chrome. I mainly played around with the style.css file... I made each class and id have a different colour. Also, I decided
to change the font of all the text displayed in the popup from Arial to Times New Roman. Finally, I changed the icon of the extension using the manifest.json file. I removed 
the default icon images given to us and replaced it with a simple png image of the letter W. 

Jan 22
-Nothing.

Jan 23
-Today I started my lab project 1. To do this, I created a manifest.json, popup.html, style.css, popup.js, content.js, and background.js files from scratch. So far, my extension
is titled 'The Letter X vs The Letter E' and opens a new tab that displays the number of times the letters X and E appeared in recently opened webpages. The point of this is to
show how infrequent the letter X is used in comparison to the letter E. Also, the css file changes the colour and fonts of all the text. This is a work in progress still...

Jan 24
-Today I continued working on my code for lab project 1. The majority of my time today was spent on playing around with the style.css file, so in other words, editing the 
colours, background, text fonts/sizes, and more. In addition, I added my name in the html file so that when the extension is opened, it displays 'By: Anthony Venditti' at the
top left hand corner. I also added in an image, almost like a logo, in the top right hand corner of the page(same image as extension icon). This is a work in progress still...

Jan 25
-Today I continued working on my code for lab project 1. Previously, the number count for the letter X was not working as it would simply just say 'undefined'. However, I was
finally able to fix this and so now the extension works properly! The issue was located in the content.js file and thus needed some tweaking. Along with this, I made some 
minor changes to the html and css files, such as changing the title name it shows at the top of the tab. This is a work in progress still...but very near finish.

Jan 26
-Today I continued working on my code for lab project 1. I believe I am just about finished my extension... I edited the background.js file because there were a few variables
that were declared that I never ended up using. The only thing left to do is to simply clean up and organize the code furthur, and maybe make additional css changes to create
a more aesthetic extension. However, the technical aspect is finished!

Jan 27
-Today I completed Quiz #1 on github.

Jan 28
-Today I finally finished and uploaded my Lab Project 1 on github to this repo and my robots-make-art-too/Anthony_Venditti repo, as well as the OneDrive folder that my TA for 
lab 3/4 had specified to submit to. 

Jan 29
-Nothing.

Jan 30
-Today I recorded a video/voiceover of me doing a demo of my extension on chrome. With this, I uploaded the demo to the OneDrive folder that my TA for lab 3/4 had specified to
submit to.

Jan 31
-Nothing... taking a little break after spending alot of time on lab project 1.

Feb 1
-Today I uploaded my demo video to my robots-make-art-too/Anthony_Venditti repo as well as my personal repo (this one).

Feb 2
-Today I created a new branch in my robots repo. In this branch, I created the Phase_1.md file as instructed, and also answered the given questions in the doc file sent on 
discord by Mehrnaz. 

Feb 3
-Today I altered and uploaded the python example sketch created during the lecture. There are a few changes I made with the original code. First, instead of one ellipse in 
the center of the screen, I created 9 ellipses within 3 rows of 3 columns. Each ellipse has a shorter diameter of rings but each ring is much closer together than before. Also,
the screen size is now 1200 x 800 and the background colour has been changed to black (from white). Finally, I edited the tone that is played when the mouse is clicked so that
an even lower pitch frequency is played, this is because the ellipse's look similar to vinyls and so I imagined as if a DJ was spinning them with that low pitch sound.
