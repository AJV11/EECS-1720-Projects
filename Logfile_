-Today I uploaded an example file of a p5.js sketch.

Jan 14
-Today I edited the p5.js sketch file. I made the background orange, the circle randomly change colours, and the position of the circle to follow the user's cursor rather than
moving randomly. A couple small changes I also made were the canvas size and the circle's size.

-Today I edited the p5.js sketch file even furthur. I made it so that now the background stays black but only refreshes when the mouse is clicked, this allows the user to use
the screen like a canvas and drag the mouse around to 'paint' circles all over until they click (essentially to restart their drawing). Also, I decided to make the circle shape
slightly smaller so that it takes more circles to fill up the canvas. And finally, to add more interactivity, the user can select the colour of the circle themself using the 
keys on their keyboard. So... click 'r' for red, click 'g' for green, click 'b' for blue, and click 'a' for random.

-Today I joined the EECS 1720 github organization 

Jan 21
-Today I edited the more-extension-demo extension on chrome. I mainly played around with the style.css file... I made each class and id have a different colour. Also, I decided
to change the font of all the text displayed in the popup from Arial to Times New Roman. Finally, I changed the icon of the extension using the manifest.json file. I removed 
the default icon images given to us and replaced it with a simple png image of the letter W.

-Nothing.

-Today I started my lab project 1. To do this, I created a manifest.json, popup.html, style.css, popup.js, content.js, and background.js files from scratch. So far, my extension
is titled 'The Letter X vs The Letter E' and opens a new tab that displays the number of times the letters X and E appeared in recently opened webpages. The point of this is to
show how infrequent the letter X is used in comparison to the letter E. Also, the css file changes the colour and fonts of all the text. This is a work in progress still...

-Today I continued working on my code for lab project 1. The majority of my time today was spent on playing around with the style.css file, so in other words, editing the 
colours, background, text fonts/sizes, and more. In addition, I added my name in the html file so that when the extension is opened, it displays 'By: Anthony Venditti' at the
top left hand corner. I also added in an image, almost like a logo, in the top right hand corner of the page(same image as extension icon). This is a work in progress still...

-Today I continued working on my code for lab project 1. Previously, the number count for the letter X was not working as it would simply just say 'undefined'. However, I was
finally able to fix this and so now the extension works properly! The issue was located in the content.js file and thus needed some tweaking. Along with this, I made some 
minor changes to the html and css files, such as changing the title name it shows at the top of the tab. This is a work in progress still...but very near finish.
