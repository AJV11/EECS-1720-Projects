Lab Project 1 - Lens for the Internet:

The Letter X vs. The Letter E

-My extension is called The Letter X vs. The Letter E which has the purpose of informing users about the infrequent use of the letter X in the English alphabet. Although that may seem obvious and irrelevant, it is quite interesting to see exactly how infrequent it is used in contrast to the most used letter, E. By clicking the extension icon, which is an image of the letter X for obvious reasons, a new tab opens up in chrome which displays the html. To make the extension visually appealing, I took advantage of the css file and changed the colours of each text element, along with the fonts and sizes. Evidently, the title is large and the text elements get slightly smaller from top to bottom of the page. Also, I placed the same image as the icon onto the page at the top right almost like a logo for my extension, and to help fill up space. Finally, in terms of the actual content, each webpage you have visited will be listed underneath the thematic break. For each webpage there will consist of its URL, as well as the count of the letter X, count of the letter E, and the difference between the two, and these three pieces of data will be listed right below the webpage's URL. This allows for a nice and organized collection of the data.
