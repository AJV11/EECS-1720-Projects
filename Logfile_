-Today I uploaded an example file of a p5.js sketch.

Jan 14
-Today I edited the p5.js sketch file. I made the background orange, the circle randomly change colours, and the position of the circle to follow the user's cursor rather than
moving randomly. A couple small changes I also made were the canvas size and the circle's size.

-Today I edited the p5.js sketch file even furthur. I made it so that now the background stays black but only refreshes when the mouse is clicked, this allows the user to use
the screen like a canvas and drag the mouse around to 'paint' circles all over until they click (essentially to restart their drawing). Also, I decided to make the circle shape
slightly smaller so that it takes more circles to fill up the canvas. And finally, to add more interactivity, the user can select the colour of the circle themself using the 
keys on their keyboard. So... click 'r' for red, click 'g' for green, click 'b' for blue, and click 'a' for random.
